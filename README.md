This is my Final Project for my Intro to Python course.
It reskins pets in stardew at the moment, pets will be added separately later to be included on top of the current pets.
Hats don't work on all at the moment.

Some sprites come from other people.

Thank you for giving me this oppurtunity to create a mod for Stardew Valley it is a game I love. If you noticed on my main save file I have multiple hours.
I had lots of fun creating some custom sprites and learning how to change some of the code in the game. I will defiently want to keep working on the mod later even after the due date of this project. The main trouble I had was not having enough time to add more pets and small details. I also was unable to find a good turorial on how to add original pets to the game instead of re-skining pets.
