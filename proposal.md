# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
Pepsi Pets+
TODO

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")
Mod that adds or reskins the pets in Stardew Valley look diffrent.
TODO

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
My software will use png files and some code to overide the current pet files in Stardew Valley. It will also change the icons at the begining so you can see the correct pet that you want to choose.

TODO

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
A good outcome will be at least 3 customized sprites showing up in the game and at the pet selection screen.

TODO

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
A BETTER outcome would be all the sprites are visible.

TODO

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
I have learned to modify the code so that it adds more pet selection instead of doing a reskin.

TODO

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
I will have to learn how to modify Stardew Valley. I will have to learn how to possibly code in C# or C#++. I will have to learn how to find and get the orignal sprite files. I will have to learn their locations and how to unpack them. I will have to learn how to create and implement my own mod.
